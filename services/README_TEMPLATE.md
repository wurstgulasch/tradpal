# ServiceName Service

TradPal microservice for [brief description of service purpose].

## Overview

This service implements [detailed description of functionality] following TradPal's microservices architecture and Best Practices.

## Architecture

### Components
- **main.py**: FastAPI service entry point with health checks
- **client.py**: Async client with circuit breaker and authentication
- **service.py**: Core business logic implementation
- **requirements.txt**: Service-specific dependencies
- **tests.py**: Unit tests for service logic

### Patterns Implemented
- ✅ **Async-First Design**: All I/O operations use asyncio
- ✅ **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience for external service calls
- ✅ **Zero-Trust Security**: mTLS and JWT authentication
- ✅ **Event-Driven**: Redis Streams for inter-service communication
- ✅ **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring

## API Endpoints

### GET /health
Health check endpoint.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "service": "service_name",
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### POST /endpoint
Main service endpoint for [describe functionality].

**Request:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "key": "value"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "optional": "data"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "result": "data"
  },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

## Dependencies

### External Services
- **Event System Service**: For event-driven communication
- **Security Service**: For authentication and authorization
- **[Other Services]**: [Describe dependencies]

### Configuration
Service configuration is managed through `config/service_settings.py`:

```python
SERVICE_NAME = "service_name"
SERVICE_URL = "http://service_name:800x"
SERVICE_PORT = 800x
ENABLE_SERVICE = True
```

## Usage

### Starting the Service
```bash
cd services/service_name
python main.py
```

### Using the Client
```python
from services.service_name.client import ServiceNameClient

client = ServiceNameClient()
await client.authenticate()

result = await client.business_method(param="value")
```

### Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
pytest tests.py

# Integration tests
pytest test_integration.py
```

## Event Integration

### Published Events
- `SERVICE_OPERATION_COMPLETED`: When operations succeed
- `SERVICE_OPERATION_FAILED`: When operations fail

### Subscribed Events
- `SERVICE_SPECIFIC_EVENT`: [Describe event handling]

## Monitoring

### Metrics
- Request count and latency
- Error rates
- Circuit breaker status

### Logs
All logs are written to `logs/tradpal.log` with structured JSON format.

## Development

### Adding New Endpoints
1. Add Pydantic models in `main.py`
2. Implement business logic in `service.py`
3. Add FastAPI route in `main.py`
4. Update client methods in `client.py`
5. Add tests in `tests.py`

### Event Handling
1. Define new event types in `services/infrastructure_service/event_system_service/__init__.py`
2. Register handlers in service initialization
3. Implement event processing methods

## Deployment

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
EXPOSE 800x

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

### Kubernetes
See `k8s-deployment.yaml` for Kubernetes deployment configuration.
