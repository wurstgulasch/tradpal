# TradPal Requirements - Microservice Architecture
#
# In our microservice architecture, each service manages its own dependencies.
# This file is kept for legacy compatibility and basic development setup.
#
# For development:
# 1. Install base environment: pip install -e .
# 2. Each service has its own requirements.txt with pinned versions
# 3. See dependency_catalog.txt for approved package versions
#
# For production deployment:
# - Each service is deployed independently with its own requirements.txt
# - Services only install what they actually need
# - Versions are consistent across all services via dependency_catalog.txt
#
# Quick development setup (installs core dependencies):
# pip install -e .[dev]
